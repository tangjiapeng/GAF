- Given a short, monocular video captured by a commodity device such as a smartphone, GAF reconstructs a 3D Gaussian head avatar, which can be re-animated and rendered into photo-realistic novel views. 
Our key idea is to distill the reconstruction constraints from a multi-view head diffusion model  in order to extrapolate to unobserved views and expressions.
